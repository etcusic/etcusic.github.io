Ok so the title may be a bit cliche, but it just seemed too appropriate not to. 

So….. why did I decide to learn software engineering?

The short answer: because I want to have a skillset that I know will remain relevant as global technology continues to develop and advance. Also, I believe that the way my mind naturally works lends itself to some talent in this discipline.

I’ve always had a mindset of trying to find the root cause of things, and then framing it in terms of problems that need to be solved. In college I got a degree in Philosophy. I had a drive to better understand what lies at the root of human existence, the self, and how I should orient my own life based on those findings. I even outlined my own metaphysical interpretation for the foundation of existence based on the writings of the early existentialists.

Once I was finished with college, I decided to start working in kitchens full time. What I enjoyed the most about cooking was working with different ingredients - taking some of the same thought processes I had learned through studying Philosophy, and then applying that to theories of flavor combination. It was a pursuit in creating delicious food that was also interesting and worthy of sparking conversation. Ultimately though, as I looked ahead at what it would mean to have a career as a chef, I decided that I didn’t want to commit to that kind of life. Besides, one doesn’t need to be a professional chef to be a cook.

I had a strong urge to travel when I left the culinary world, so I decided to link up with a small NGO in southeast Asia. This allowed me to experience different cultures, different food, a completely different way of life, and do something meaningful at the same time. With the NGO I settled into a role in logistics and helped to organize efficient systems for procuring, transporting, and tracking supplies for the organization. While I loved the organization I was working for, I became increasingly more aware of my gap in acquired skills outside of the kitchen. I knew that I needed to figure out a way to apply my talents in learning a skill set that would allow me to contribute more meaningfully to the world moving forward….. and also one that could provide a steady income.

I considered several different options, and then I took a personality test that suggested I would have an aptitude toward software engineering. Really? Terms like “software engineering” and “computer science” sound like intimidating disciplines that require fancy degrees. In spite of my initial reaction, I started doing some research. It seemed to highlight: the need to use conditional logic (check - philosophy), creativity in finding solutions and bringing them together (check - cooking), and the ability to create flexible and efficient systems (check - logistics and kitchens). Now…. this doesn’t make it a given that I’ll be a great programmer. That comes from hard work, diligence, and persistence. But I’m ready to commit myself fully to it. Let’s go!
